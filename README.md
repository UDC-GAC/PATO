PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr is a high performance tool for the fast and
efficient detection of triple helices and triplex features in nucleotide
sequences. PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr is a modern alternative to
[Triplexator](https://github.com/Gurado/triplexator) and
[TDF](https://github.com/CostaLab/reg-gen) and functions as a drop in
replacement to accelerate the triplex analyses in multicore computers. Moreover,
PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr's efficiency allows a more exhaustive search
of the triplex-forming solution space, and so it achieves higher levels of
prediction accuracy in far less time than other tools in the state of the art.
