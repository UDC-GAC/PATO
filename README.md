PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr is a high performance tool for the fast and efficient detection of triple helices and triplex features in nucleotide sequences. PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr, [Triplexator](https://github.com/Gurado/triplexator), and [TDF](https://github.com/CostaLab/reg-gen) are exact algorithms, and so PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr functions nearly as a drop in replacement to accelerate the triplex analyses in multicore computers and achieves the same level of prediction accuracy as that of the state of the art.

## Version
Version v0.0.0.

## Requirements
To compile and execute PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr, the following software is required:
* GNU Make
* C++ compiler (c++17 compliant and with support for OpenMP directives)

For instance, a valid combination of these tools may be: GNU Make v3.82, and GCC v9.3.0.

## Compilation
Download the source code from this repository, either use Git or download a copy from GitHub, and let GNU Make automatically compile PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr for you:
```bash
user@host:/path/to/pato$ make gnu -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
```

## Execution
Now that PATO: high PerformAnce TriplexatOr has been compiled, execute the application as follows:
```bash
user@host:/path/to/pato$ ./target/gnu/pato.release [options] {-ss tfo_file | -ds tts_file | -ss tfo_file -ds tts_file}
```

Execute `./target/gnu/pato.release --help` for a detailed list of execution modes, options, and flags.

## Test
If you are interested in testing the correctness of your installation, run the following commands:
```bash
user@host:/path/to/pato$ make gnu -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) BUILD=release
user@host:/path/to/pato$ make gnu -j$(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) BUILD=serial
user@host:/path/to/pato$ bash test/test.bash gnu
```
