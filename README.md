PATO: PArallel TriplexatOr is a high performance tool for the fast and efficient detection of acid triple helices and triplex features in nucleotide sequences. PATO: PArallel TriplexatOr is based on [Triplexator](https://github.com/Gurado/triplexator) and functions nearly as a drop in replacement to accelerate the triplex analyses in multicore computers.
